On developing apps or products, we may have different versions of that product. If the new
version is updated then, the previous version code should also be maintained.
So, such maintaining of versions is carried by version control system. There are different version control
systems like git, mercurial, perforce etc.

Need of Version Control System
=> To maintain product versions.
=> For team collaboration in a project.


The codes of project should be stored somewhere in the cloud. Google drive or any other cloud storage
services can be used for storing code, but they doesn't provide git support and there will be more
manual work for team collaboration.
So, we use cloud services which understand git instead of google drives.
The example of such cloud services which understand git are, GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket etc.
