# There may be different projects in your system with different requirement of packages
# Your one project may require pandas version 2.1 whereas other project may require pandas version 2.4
# So to solve this problem we can use the concept of virtual environment

# Virtual environment is a separate environment in your system where we can install packages
# in isolated form for each project.

# Important Commands
1. python -m venv venv
        => Creates a new virtual environment
2. venv\Scripts\activate  (for windows devices in command prompt)
   source venv/bin/activate (for mac devices)
        => activates the virtual environment
3. deactivate
        => It deactivates the virtual environment

4. pip install <package_name>
    => It installs the package to the environment

5. pip freeze
    => It shows all the installed packages in the environment

6. pip freeze > requirements.txt
    => It creates a file "requirements.txt" consisting of all the packages
7. pip install -r requirements.txt
    => Recursively installs all the packages from requirements.txt file
