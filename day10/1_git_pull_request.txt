=> While working on a professional project we do not merge codes from other branches to the main
branch in local.
=> The codes in the main branch should always go through a review process known as Pull Request.
=> Pull Request is opened in the github. It can be opened by selecting two branches; one branch is the
feature branch and another is the main branch.
